/**
  * This sketch demonstrates how to use the BeatDetect object in FREQ_ENERGY mode.<br />
  * You can use <code>isKick</code>, <code>isSnare</code>, </code>isHat</code>, <code>isRange</code>, 
  * and <code>isOnset(int)</code> to track whatever kind of beats you are looking to track, they will report 
  * true or false based on the state of the analysis. To "tick" the analysis you must call <code>detect</code> 
  * with successive buffers of audio. You can do this inside of <code>draw</code>, but you are likely to miss some 
  * audio buffers if you do this. The sketch implements an <code>AudioListener</code> called <code>BeatListener</code> 
  * so that it can call <code>detect</code> on every buffer of audio processed by the system without repeating a buffer 
  * or missing one.
  * <p>
  * This sketch plays an entire song so it may be a little slow to load.
  * <p>
